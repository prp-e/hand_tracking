# Hand Tracking using Google's Mediapipe 

Google's [mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe) is a very cool library for detecting movements and poses. I had some ideas in mind, and part of it is in form of this repository. This will be part of a much bigger project as soon as possible, so stay tuned for it :)
